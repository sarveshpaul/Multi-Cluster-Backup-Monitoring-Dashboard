# Multi-Cluster Backup Monitoring

## Project Objective
The **Multi-Cluster Backup Monitoring** project aims to develop an informative and visually appealing Power BI dashboard. This dashboard provides insights into the backup status across multiple server clusters within the Ace Infra Team. By closely monitoring backup health metrics, we enhance data protection strategies and ensure uninterrupted business continuity.

## Dashboard Highlights
1. **DC: Data Health % Status**
   - This section offers an overview of data health metrics.
   - Color-coded indicators provide immediate visibility into data quality.
   - Trends over time allow for ongoing analysis and decision-making.

2. **Project Wise VM Group Backup Status**
   - Here, we present backup success rates categorized by different projects or VM groups.
   - Warnings or failures are highlighted, prompting necessary actions.
   - Users can drill down into specific projects for detailed examination.

3. **Application Wise VM Group Backup Status**
   - At the application level, this section displays backup status.
   - Critical issues are promptly flagged.
   - Application-specific insights guide targeted interventions.

4. **Activities of Backup by Date**
   - The timeline of backup events is visualized through area charts.
   - Patterns and anomalies can be identified.
   - Date-wise analysis helps track backup trends.

5. **Environment Wise VM Group Backup Status**
   - This section provides backup status across different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
   - Environment-specific trends are crucial for optimizing backup processes.

6. **Cluster Wise VM Group Backup Status**
   - Backup status is analyzed at the server cluster level.
   - Cluster-level performance metrics guide optimization efforts.

## Key Learnings
Throughout this project, we gained valuable insights, including:
- Effective data visualization techniques.
- Proactive monitoring of backup health.
- Creation of actionable dashboards for informed decision-making.
